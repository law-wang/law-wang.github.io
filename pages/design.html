        <h3 class="content-title">On the Hill</h3>
        <p class="content-text">Inspired by the New Zealand landscape of boundless open grasslands and steep mountains, this 3 story residence is set against the foot of a hill, with a flat pasture in front. The glass facade provides maximum lighting into the residence and guarantees unobstructed view of the outside for anywhere in the house. Combined with the prevalent use of glass, the stone sides present my interpretation of minimalism and modernity. The final illustration is completed in marker and pen.</p>

        <p class="content-text">A product design idea for a prosthetic arm. The illustration uses Stephanie Grebe, an award-winning Paralympian for table tennis as a case study model. The design features a changeable ball-socket joint that is compatible with many functional devices. For this project, I first envisioned a problem and then researched for details on the problem. The ideas and potential design brainstorms are on paper, while the final rendering was completed with Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>

        <p class="content-text">A product design idea for a cup holder that plays music through bone conduction technology. Music, tea, and coffee drinks all have healing and de-stressing powers. The project seeks to solve the problem of stress with a creative and natural solution, where relaxing music would be played when drinking from the cup.
