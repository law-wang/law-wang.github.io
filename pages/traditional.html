        <h3 class="content-title">Flashlight</h3>
        <p class="content-text">The transcendence of a jellyfish as triggered by purple photons. The volumetric shapes are inspired by my experimentation with various fluid forms in Cinema 4D: the digital software’s ability to manipulate glossy textures and to capture bodies in motion sparked my interest in the specific concept. Through this piece, I wanted to show how objects interact with each other and how light and shadow function holistically in a setting.</p>

        <p class="content-text">Telephone poles in the representative shape of cross. In the modern society of digital exchange, has technology become the new god? Construction of the piece involved combination of various textures, such as the smooth marker and plastic, the rough strokes of colored pencils, and the unique, cloud-like foam background. Through presenting the process of fluid shapes morphing into distinct modular buildings, I hope to convey the road from elemental units to advanced civilization, and how the progress towards technology continues to shape our journey.</p>

        <p class="content-text">Bubbles escaping the constraints of a wood and steel cage. An attempt to connect the elements in my painting with real life structures. The bubbles represent the ephemerality of life, whereas the cage symbolizes the limiting effects of societal preconceptions. The piece seeks to convey the ideas of journey, fluid forms, and freedom that are present in my other works. To complete the piece, I used wood and steel to create the cage and blow-able balloons for the delicateness of the bubbles.</p>

        <p class="content-text">Chase the waves. What will you find? Pen drawing inspired by fictional elements combined with Chinese myths. Take the journey upward with the waves and you’ll meet the mythical, ritualistic bronze tree, rumored to be built during the Shang dynasty to connect the mortal world with the heavens. Aside from the extensive use of symbols, I focused on creating depth with line weight and using line density to establish the hierarchy of elements.</p>

        <p class="content-text">An attempt to convey the uncertainty, instability, and ephemerality of the universe. Revolving around a tree with blowing spheres, the transient and amorphous water droplets are confined into preset, perfect pear shapes, signifying the limitations imposed by the world and society. Through layering shades of pencil, I utilized the soft and pliable nature of the medium to convey the theme.</p>

        <p class="content-text">The fall of the Qing dynasty marked the end of an age. Thousands of years of imperial rule crumbled in the face of new technologies, corruption, and the Xinhai Revolution. Combining various historic elements, I attempted to build meaning with the negative space. Through organizing the elements, I created a sense of space and depth through the indication of direction, the use of shadows, and contrast between white, shaded, and colored regions.</p>

        <p class="content-text">Straight-forward landscape study turned experiment in depth and atmosphere using contrasting colors, values, and texture. Depth created through controlling the temperature. I explored various shades of blue, juxtaposing them with warmer tones of brown and orange in the foreground. The medium offers a unique texture that reinforces the cool, smooth, but clear scenery.</p>

        <p class="content-text">A portal to completely different worlds. The foreground is rendered as a romantic reminiscence of my childhood, while the mid-ground through the archway represents the precision that high school life demands. Far away, the rising waves transform into thunderclouds that are, like the future, yet to be colored. The creative process included understanding different strategies of brushstrokes and color combinations. The experimentation with various textures and styles created an eclectic piece that combines painterly, surrealist, and impressionist influences.</p>
