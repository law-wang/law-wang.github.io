I"<p>It’s getting warmer in Los Angeles (which makes me miss, somewhat, the chilly mornings when I had to wake up at 6 to attend Zoom University — how masochistic of me). Summer is coming, the best batch of loquat is ready for picking, the crisis-mode-marked-by-six-feet-apart-crosses line at Costco, well, probably hasn’t actually changed but subconsciously it seems shorter. After all, it’s not just you and me who are not going anywhere: “no one’s going anywhere,” and as Lana famously said: “the culture is lit.”</p>
