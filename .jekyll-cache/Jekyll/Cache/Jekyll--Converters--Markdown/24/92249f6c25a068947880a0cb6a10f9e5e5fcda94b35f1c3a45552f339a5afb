I"<p>For me, a good Lana song does two things: 1) it makes me fall asleep and 2) it gives me edgy inspiration upon further examination (while I’m awake, of course). As such, it should come as no surprise that The Next Best American Record happened to be the first song from <em>Norman Fucking Rockwell!</em> that I fell for — the nonsensical lyrics are so fun to decode, though they probably mean nothing, and the song drags on and on and on until it leaves me in the perfect slumber — certainly enviable merits. </p>
