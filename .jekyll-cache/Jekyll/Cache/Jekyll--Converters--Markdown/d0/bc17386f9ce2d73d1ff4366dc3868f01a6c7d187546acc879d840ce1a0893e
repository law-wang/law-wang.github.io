I"‚<p>The problematic thing about an international public health emergency that forces the closure of schools, restaurants, and social events, aside from the fact that Iâ€™ve been rotting away at home and canâ€™t even find solace in the slim chance that I might be able to go to Glastonbury over the summer since both Glastonbury and London and my study abroad program are likely cancelled, is the fact that I canâ€™t even listen to music in peace anymore. Iâ€™ve always found it interesting, the way we are conditioned to associate certain memories with music and how they evoke the same emotional and conscious response every time, but never have I found it so infuriating. So many songs in my Spotify library have such distinct moments written across them that it becomes impossible to listen to practically anything without wondering, with the utmost confusion, where did my freshman year go?</p>
