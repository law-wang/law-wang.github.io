I"®<p>Breaking into the Chinese film market in 2002, <em>Hero</em> became the box office legend of the year. Though it still remains one of the biggest domestic releases of all time, many Chinese film critics at the time criticized the story for being too simple, that it only had beautiful pictures but lacked a soul. Internationally, however, <em>Hero</em> did extremely well as it was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 2003 Oscars. Regardless, <em>Hero</em> marked a milestone for the Chinese film industry. After its release, the industry prospered in an era of big investment and big production business model, forging a period of immense growth in the film market in China.</p>
