I"X<p>Ladies and gentlemen, teachers, administrators, Class of 2019:  <br /><br />
Good evening. It is an absolute honor to be here. Six years ago, when I arrived in America, quite literally “fresh off the boat,” I never imagined I would be standing here. When I first stepped foot on Troy’s campus, I was entirely clueless about my future. Now, standing here at graduation, I know exactly the direction I’m going in life! Just kidding, I’m just as clueless as freshman year, but I do know that my experiences at Troy will serve as the foundation of whatever I decide to do in the future.</p>
