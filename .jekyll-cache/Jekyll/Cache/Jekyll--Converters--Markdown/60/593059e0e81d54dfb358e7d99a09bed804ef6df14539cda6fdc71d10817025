I"Q<p>18 would be a tie-dyed kaleidoscope of colors in my imagination: I would run around the neighborhood like I promise myself everyday (<em>and watch one less YouTube video</em>). I would be driving around town ordering iced coffee at 1 A.M. (<em>because I wouldâ€™ve gotten my DL before my permit expired</em>). I would be getting ice cream at Venice, having spontaneous road trips, or visiting the Broad. I would actually have a senior quote (<em>thanks Troy High School</em>), actually understand Chemistry, actually not care about school, and actually magically get a 5 on AP Spanish.</p>
