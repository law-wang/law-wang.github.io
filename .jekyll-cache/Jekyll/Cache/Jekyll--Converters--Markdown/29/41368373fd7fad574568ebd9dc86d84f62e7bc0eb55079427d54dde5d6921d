I"<p><em>Gone Girl</em> and <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> — released two years apart, one by the legendary David Fincher, the other by the fashion mongol Tom Ford — are strikingly similar in many ways. Both contain wonderful shots, such as when Ben Affleck’s fingers run through Rosamund Pike’s hair and when Amy Adams stands in front of the mirror in her green dress as A Table For Two plays in the background. <em>Gone Girl</em> describes the aftermath of a girl losing the perfect guy she was promised, whereas <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> describes that of a guy losing his wife and child. Now, maybe Tom Ford’s use of color and treatment of silence makes his work the more artsy of the two, but we should all be able to agree that the two share a common discussion of love and revenge.</p>
