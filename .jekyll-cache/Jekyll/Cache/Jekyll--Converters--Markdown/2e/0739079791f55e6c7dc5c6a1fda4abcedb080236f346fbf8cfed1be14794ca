I"Ñ<p>What did the 2010s mean to you? What do you remember? Late night procrastination, chilling watching television? Walking to Starbucks after school, walking to school from Starbucks? Crying when opening the college admissions portal, crying with the shower running only to be heard by your parents anyway? Was it a nightmare, a mad trip, a flavored kool-aid? Was it existential, or empty, or cold, sometimes lonely? Golden? like a Ferrari on Mulholland drive?</p>
