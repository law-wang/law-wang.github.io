<p>If <em>Pure Heroine</em> was about teenage Lordeâ€™s idea of maturity, her imagination of what the adult world must be like, then her sophomore album is precisely the opposite. <em>Melodrama</em> is coolâ€” the toned quality materializes through the predominantly blue album art. And with this record, the brilliant facade of the adult world peels off layer by layer, until all thatâ€™s left is the delicate, jaded, melancholic core.</p>
